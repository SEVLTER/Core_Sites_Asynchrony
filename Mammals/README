This folder contains scripts and data to link SEV LTER mammal abundance data (Desert grassland and shrubland) to plant asynchrony data.
You will need to change the working directories in the scripts to match your device.

Order of operations
1. Make plant synchrony dataset at web scale from all plant quads data (Sevilleta_allbiomass_05Feb2023) using sev_plant_synchrony_web_scale_mammals_09-22.R
This creates the dataset: asynchrony_stability_allwebs_mammals.csv


2. Make mammal datasets at web scale from raw mammal count data (sev008_rodentpopns_20231002.csv) using sev_smammal_data_wrangling_asynchrony.R
This creates the dataset with total mammal abundance/stability: mammal_total_async_stability.csv
And, a dataset with mammal species abundance/stability: mammal_species_async_stability.csv
Note: Mammal trapping was inconsistent across years from 1989 - 2023. You can look at that inconsistency in sev008_rodentpopns_20231002_pivot_to_see_years.xls

3. Statistical analysis: sev_mammal_stability_async_analysis_2023.R
