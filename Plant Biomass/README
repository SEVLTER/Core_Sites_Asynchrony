This folder contains scripts and data to complete analysis of plant biomass and species biomass asynchrony.
All scripts require that you change the working directory to match your device.

Order of operations - Plant data at the scale of 1 m X 1 m quadrats

1. Use script sev_plant_synchrony_2023.R to get synchrony and biomass stability metrics from all plant data (Sevilleta_allbiomass_05Feb2023.csv)
this creates asynchrony_stability_allquads.csv to use for analysis
and plant species - level stability metrics plant_species_stability.csv
At the end of this script you can also add plant traits using the plant traits database: sev_all_traits_2023.csv
to create plant_species_stability_traits.csv

2. To do statistical analysis use sev_plant_synchrony_analysis_2023.R with dataoutput file asynchrony_stability_allquads.csv

Order of operations - Plant data at the scale of mammal trapping webs 

(relevant to bees, grasshoppers - but mammals require a different timeline to match mammal sampling - see Mammals folder)
1. Use script sev_plant_synchrony_data_wrangling_web_scale_2023 to get synchrony and biomass stability metrics from all plant data (Sevilleta_allbiomass_05Feb2023.csv)

2. To do statistical analysis use sev_plant_synchrony_webscale_analysis_2023.R
